# 🔍 Function Signatures

This document is automatically generated from the Python source code in `smash_core/`.

It shows the **top-level public functions** for each file, along with:

- 🧾 Function signature (name, parameters, return type)
- 📘 Top 3 lines of the docstring (if present)
- 📏 Line count
- 🧠 Static complexity metrics:
  - Branches (`if` / `else`)
  - Loops (`for` / `while`)
  - Calls (other functions used)
  - Local variables (assignments)
  - Nesting depth
- ✅ Type hint usage

Functions starting with `_` are excluded by default.

This reference helps:

- Developers discover available helpers and APIs
- LLMs understand callable building blocks
- Contributors identify large, undocumented, or complex code
