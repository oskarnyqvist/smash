# 🔍 Function Signatures

This document is auto-generated from the Python source files in `smash_core/`.

It lists all **top-level public functions**, grouped by file, and includes:

- 🧾 Function signature (name, parameters, return type)
- 📘 Docstring (if available)
- 📏 Line count (estimated)
- 🧠 Static complexity metrics:
  - Branches (`if`, `else`)
  - Loops (`for`, `while`)
  - Function calls
  - Local variables (assignments)
  - Nesting depth
- ✅ Type hint presence

Functions starting with `_` are excluded by default.

## 🧠 How to Use This

- 🔍 Quickly explore available helper functions and internal APIs
- ⚙️ Understand the shape and complexity of core logic
- 🧪 Identify functions that may need tests, docs, or refactors
- 🤖 Give LLMs enough context to rewrite or call safely
