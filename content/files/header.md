# 🗂 File Overview

This document is a **human- and LLM-friendly index** of the Smash codebase.

It lists all key Python files by directory, along with:

- 🧾 File paths and short descriptions
- 🧮 Approximate line counts
- 🔧 Top-level functions (when present)
- 📦 Import dependencies (if relevant)

The structure mirrors the actual filesystem and reflects the roles of each module.

This file is auto-generated by `content/files/smashlet.py` and updated on demand via `smash`.

## 🧠 How to Use This

- 📍 Understand where logic lives (`commands/`, `helpers/`, `project/`, etc.)
- 🚀 Discover entry points, CLI commands, and public helpers
- 🧱 Help LLMs regenerate or refactor individual modules safely
- 🔍 Speed up onboarding, code reviews, and navigation

> This index includes CLI files, tests, and internals — not just importable modules — to show the full system layout and execution paths.
