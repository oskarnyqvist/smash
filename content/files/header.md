# ðŸ—‚ File Overview

This document provides a **human- and LLM-readable map** of the Smash codebase.

Each section lists Python source files by directory, along with:

- ðŸ§¾ Path and short description
- ðŸ§® Line counts
- ðŸ”§ Defined functions (for modules)
- ðŸ“¦ Import dependencies (when relevant)

This index is auto-generated by `content/files/smashlet.py` and reflects the current project structure.

Use this to:

- Understand where logic lives (`commands/`, `helpers/`, `project/`, etc.)
- Explore function entry points and CLI integrations
- Help LLMs and tools locate and regenerate code safely
- Guide refactors, onboarding, or review

> Files like tests and CLI commands are included to show how Smash is organized and executed â€” not just what's importable.
