### Philosophy

Smash is built around a few simple principles:

- ðŸ“¦ Build logic should live with the files it transforms
- âœ¨ Behavior should be predictable and explicit
- ðŸ¤– Everything should be understandable by both humans and LLMs
- ðŸ’¡ Smashlets should be self-contained, portable units
- ðŸ§± No global state, no hidden dependencies

No DAGs. No YAMLs. No magic.
