How are smashlets authored? Is there a prescribed format or template?

Are smashlets allowed to have dependencies, or are they meant to be self-contained?

How extensible is the system (e.g., can you plug in new context loaders or build strategies)?

 Step 1: Understand the Big Picture
What’s the goal of Smash?

What problems is it solving?

How are smashlets supposed to be used in a real project?

Any examples or demos? That helps ground abstract code in real workflows.




-

Is the context schema fixed or user-extensible?

What are the expectations for smashlet side-effects? (Pure vs impure)

How stable is the API — is it safe to build plugins or integrations?

Do you envision a registry of smashlets or templates?


---


I expect:

To define small, composable tasks (smashlets) for things like:

Converting data formats

Compiling or transforming assets

Running linters or codegen

Any “if input changes → do X” task

Tasks should auto-skip if they don't need to run (based on timestamps or context hashes).

Basically: “Only do work that’s necessary, and let me describe that work in a clean Python script.”

2. Context-Driven Behavior
The context system is really powerful.

I’d use it to:

Inject dynamic config (e.g. environment, project settings)

Load local overrides without hardcoding anything

Drive logic from context["something"] rather than command-line flags

It gives me declarative data-injected scripting, which is a huge step up from traditional shell scripts.

If I were adopting **Smash** in my own workflows, I'd use it as a **"glue layer" for project-specific automation** — especially in places where traditional tools feel too heavy, too rigid, or too messy.

Here’s what I’d use it for, broken down by use case 👇

---

## 🔬 **1. Data & ML Projects**
Smash shines here — lots of semi-structured steps with inputs/outputs and context needs.

### I'd use Smash for:
- **Data preprocessing**: Convert raw data → clean CSV/JSON/Parquet
- **Model training pipelines**: Run training if code/data/context changed
- **Result caching**: Skip expensive steps if nothing changed
- **Visualization generation**: Auto-regenerate plots when data updates
- **Notebook orchestration**: Run notebooks as scripts with context injection

> Bonus: I can use `context["env"]`, `context["model_type"]`, etc. to drive dynamic behavior.

---

## 🛠️ **2. Dev Tools / Codegen / Meta Work**
This is super common in full-stack or systems projects.

### I'd use Smash for:
- **Generating config files** (e.g., from YAML → .env, Dockerfile)
- **Compiling static assets** (SASS → CSS, markdown → HTML)
- **Running linters/code formatters** *only when needed*
- **Templated file generation** (like `smash add` does already)
- **Maintaining test fixtures** (rebuild data, mocks, snapshots)

> It’s perfect for those in-between jobs that aren’t quite build tasks, but need automation.

---

## 🧱 **3. Static Site or Docs Automation**
For projects with documentation, marketing pages, or personal blogs:

- Build pages from markdown or Jupyter notebooks
- Auto-copy static assets (icons, fonts, etc.)
- Rebuild only the changed parts
- Publish output to GitHub Pages or S3

> Smashlets could run markdown converters, image optimizers, link checkers, etc.

---

## 🔁 **4. Local CI / Smoke Tests**
For quick sanity checks *before* pushing:

- Check if specific files changed and then run:
  - `pytest`
  - `mypy`
  - `black --check`
  - Custom test scripts
- Keep local “lint pipelines” fast and context-aware

> Could also integrate with pre-commit hooks or Git filters.

---

## ⚡️ **5. Quick Prototyping / Build Systems for Prototypes**
In any new repo where I’d usually toss in a few adhoc scripts, I’d replace them with:

- `smashlet_setup_env.py`
- `smashlet_generate_schema.py`
- `smashlet_run_report.py`

And then let `smash run` handle orchestration + caching.

---

### 🧠 The Golden Use Case

> **If I have a project with many small, scriptable, input-output-based steps that shouldn’t always re-run — Smash is perfect.**

---

Would you be using it more for data workflows, dev automation, or something else? I could riff ideas specific to that.

Where It Could Expand (Without Losing Its Soul)
The README is clear and focused, but some valid directions for optional growth:

📦 Plugin ecosystem (e.g. "smashlets" for common tasks like Markdown → HTML, data → charts, etc.)

🔌 Extensible smashlet patterns, e.g. post_run() hooks, dependencies between smashlets

🧪 Built-in test runner for smashlets (validate outputs, dry-run mode)

🌍 Remote execution hooks for syncing outputs or publishing results (opt-in)

But these would need to be opt-in, modular, and non-intrusive — to stay true to the core philosophy: no magic, just Python and files.
