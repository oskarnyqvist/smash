### üß† **Code Quality & Maintainability**

- **add_type_hints**  
  Add consistent type hints across all function signatures to support static analysis, better IDE experience, and safer refactors.

- **write_missing_docstrings**  
  Write or expand docstrings for all public and internal functions, especially those like `update_runlog` and `get_digest`, to clarify intent and usage.

- **refactor_nested_logic**  
  Break down overly nested functions (e.g. `should_run`, `run_status`) into smaller helpers to improve readability, reduce cognitive load, and enable isolated testing.

- **deduplicate_common_logic**  
  Extract repeated patterns (e.g. context loading, smashlet discovery) from multiple modules into shared helpers to promote reuse and DRY principles.

- **clarify_module_boundaries**  
  Separate internal modules (e.g. `project.py`, `smashlets.py`) from public APIs using clearer naming or subpackages (e.g. `_internal/`) to enforce encapsulation.

---

### üß™ **Testing & Reliability**

- **expand_test_coverage**  
  Add tests for functions with little or no coverage (e.g. `helpers.py`, `context_loader.py`), including edge cases and error scenarios.

- **parametrize_tests**  
  Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to cover common variations (e.g. different glob patterns, missing/partial context files) without repeating code.

- **test_uncovered_paths**  
  Write tests for negative and edge-case flows (e.g. corrupted JSON, unsupported file formats in context loaders, broken smashlets).

- **assert_output_consistency**  
  Verify that functions like `write_output_if_changed` and `run_smashlet` behave consistently in repeated runs (i.e. they skip unnecessary writes).

- **mock_file_io**  
  Use mocking (`unittest.mock`, `pytest` fixtures) to simulate filesystem and I/O conditions more precisely without relying on temp files or real disk writes.

- **add_smoke_tests_for_cli**  
  Add basic integration-level smoke tests that invoke CLI commands (e.g. `smash build`, `smash status`) end-to-end to validate system behavior.

### üöÄ **Performance & Scalability**

- **optimize_build_flow**  
  Analyze and improve the performance of `run_build()` and smashlet execution ‚Äî especially in large projects ‚Äî by profiling bottlenecks.

- **support_incremental_builds**  
  Cache intermediate results or track fine-grained file dependencies to avoid re-running unchanged smashlets.

- **enable_parallel_execution**  
  Run independent smashlets concurrently using `asyncio`, multiprocessing, or thread pools to reduce total build time.

- **debounce_context_loading**  
  Avoid redundant context merging by caching or reusing loaded context data across smashlets during a single build.

- **batch_stat_calls**  
  Minimize filesystem access (e.g. `stat`, `exists`) in `should_run()` by batching or memoizing results to reduce I/O overhead.

- **lightweight_status_mode**  
  Optimize `smash status` for large repos by skipping unnecessary computations (like full context resolution) when only a summary is needed.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Developer Experience (DX)**

- **improve_logging_flexibility**  
  Upgrade the `log()` system to support log levels (info, warn, error), structured output (e.g. JSON or timestamps), and environment-based verbosity control.

- **document_api_usage**  
  Add examples and usage patterns for core functions (`read`, `write`, `log`, etc.) in the main docs to guide smashlet authors and new contributors.

- **define_public_api**  
  Clearly define which modules and functions are considered public/stable (e.g. via `__all__` or documentation), and separate them from internal utilities.

- **add_cli_help_examples**  
  Expand CLI help output (`smash --help`, `smash add --help`, etc.) with real usage examples, default values, and descriptions for better discoverability.

- **add_context_debug_mode**  
  Add a debug flag (e.g. `--debug-context`) that prints the resolved context for a smashlet, helping users understand what data is injected.

- **autocomplete_support**  
  Provide optional shell completion scripts for `bash`, `zsh`, and `fish` to make the CLI feel more native and efficient.

- **track_last_run_feedback**  
  Store the last N log lines from a smashlet run in the runlog or a `.smash/logs/` directory so users can quickly see what changed or failed.

---

### üì¶ **Architecture & Extensibility**

- **plan_for_plugins**  
  Design a lightweight plugin system to support user-contributed smashlets, templates, or context processors ‚Äî possibly via entry points or a plugin registry.

- **support_custom_hooks**  
  Allow users to define custom pre/post hooks for smashlets or build events (e.g. `on_context_loaded`, `on_smashlet_finished`) for more control over behavior.

- **define_extension_points**  
  Explicitly document where and how the system can be extended ‚Äî such as adding new CLI subcommands, customizing build logic, or injecting context.

- **modularize_cli**  
  Refactor CLI handling (in `cli.py`) to be more modular, so that new subcommands can be added dynamically ‚Äî potentially by plugins.

- **isolate_runtime_logic**  
  Separate core execution logic (e.g. running smashlets, writing logs) into a clean, reusable runtime layer that could be reused in other tools or environments.

- **version_smashlet_apis**  
  Introduce a versioning scheme for smashlet features or API expectations, so older smashlets don‚Äôt break when newer versions of Smash are used.

- **export_context_schema**  
  Define and optionally export a JSON schema or manifest of the available context keys and types, to help tooling and validation.
