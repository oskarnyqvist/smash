## [Docs] Documentation clarity & cleanup pass

### What it does

Reviews and refines all existing documentation files:

- `README.md`
- Files in `docs/` (GUIDE, CODE, TASKS, etc.)

Focus is on improving clarity, reducing redundancy, and removing anything that isn’t up-to-date or essential. We should treat tokens as precious — only say what matters.

Also identifies gaps where examples, behavior, or principles are missing.

### Why it matters

Smash’s philosophy is built on clear thinking and local reasoning.  
The docs should reflect that: no fluff, no outdated examples, no redundant explanations. Just the right amount of guidance to empower users, contributors, and LLMs.

High-quality docs make Smash easier to adopt, extend, and trust.

### Hints

- Start with `README.md` — is everything relevant and current?
- Review each `docs/*.md` file:
  - Does it explain intent, not just implementation?
  - Is anything repeated or unnecessary?
  - Could it be broken up, renamed, or merged?
- Are the examples simple and meaningful?
- Is terminology consistent? (smashlet, context, runlog, etc.)

This task can be done in parts — even identifying what needs changing is valuable.
