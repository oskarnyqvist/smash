Absolutely â€” hereâ€™s a complete task story for generating `docs/context.md` from a smashlet, ready for your backlog:

---

## ðŸ“„ `[Docs] Add smashlet to generate context documentation (docs/context.md)`

### What it does

Creates a smashlet that generates `docs/context.md`, explaining how the `context` object works in Smash. It covers project-level and smashlet-local context files, file formats, override rules, and usage examples.

---

### Why it matters

- `context` is one of the most important ideas in Smash
- Contributors and LLMs need a clear mental model for how data is injected into smashlets
- Makes workflows more predictable and configurable
- Aligns with Smashâ€™s philosophy: **clear, local, explicit**

---

### Output

Generates a Markdown file like:

```markdown
# ðŸ§  Smash Context

The `context` object is passed to `run(context)`...

## Project-level context

...

## Smashlet-local context

...

## File types

...

## Example

...
```

---

### Source

The smashlet itself can be hardcoded â€” no dynamic scanning needed.

Later improvements might:

- Auto-document actual keys used by the project
- Detect presence of `context/` folders
- List `.json` files found in root and smashlet dirs

---

### Verification

- Run the smashlet â†’ creates or updates `docs/context.md`
- Contents should include:
  - Description of `context`
  - Examples of usage
  - Table of supported file types
  - Notes on override behavior

---

### Suggested filename

```
generate_context_docs.md
```

Let me know if you want a companion smashlet that outputs this now.
