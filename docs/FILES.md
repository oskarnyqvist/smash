## smash/
- `smash/__init__.py`
    Public API for writing smashlets.
    Exposes helper functions like `read`, `write`, `log`, and `write_output_if_changed`,
    so that smashlets don't need to import from internal modules.
     Lines of code: 22
     (Imports: smash_core.files, smash_core.helpers, smash_core.log)

## smash_core/
- `smash_core/__init__.py`
     Lines of code: 7
     (Imports: smash_core.helpers)
- `smash_core/cli.py`
    Command-line entry point for Smash.
    Parses arguments and dispatches to subcommands like `init`, `build`, `add`, `run`, and `status`.
    This is the main script run when you type `smash` in the terminal.
     Functions: main
     Lines of code: 55
     (Imports: argparse, smash_core.commands, smash_core.commands.status)

    Implements the logic behind `smash add`, with support for multiple boilerplate templates.
     Functions: run_add_smashlet
     Lines of code: 89
     (Imports: pathlib, smash_core.log)
- `smash_core/commands/build.py`
    Runs the main Smash build loop and powers the `smash run` command.
    Discovers all smashlets, checks if they should run, and executes them in modification-time order.
    Used by the public CLI, but not part of the importable API.
     Functions: run_build, run_force
     Lines of code: 64
     (Imports: pathlib, smash_core.context_loader, smash_core.log, smash_core.project, smash_core.smashlets)

     Functions: run_init
     Lines of code: 21
     (Imports: pathlib, smash_core.log)
- `smash_core/commands/status.py`

     Lines of code: 85
     (Imports: pathlib, smash_core.context_loader, smash_core.log, smash_core.project, smash_core.smashlets, time)
- `smash_core/context_loader.py`
    Loads the full context dictionary used during a Smash build or smashlet run.
    It merges project-level context files, local override files, and optional logic from `smash.py`.
    This context is injected into each smashletâ€™s `run()` function.
     Functions: load_context_data, build_context
     Lines of code: 71
     (Imports: json, pathlib)
- `smash_core/files.py`
    Provides path-safe `read`, `write`, and `resolve` functions for use in smashlets.
    These functions interpret paths relative to the smashlet's directory (`context["cwd"]`) or project root.
    Exposed to users via the public `smash` API.
     Functions: resolve, read, write
     Lines of code: 36
     (Imports: pathlib)
- `smash_core/helpers.py`

     Functions: get_digest, read_text_files, write_output, smash_log, ensure_dir, flatten_json_dir, write_output_if_changed
     Lines of code: 58
     (Imports: hashlib, pathlib, smash_core.files)
- `smash_core/log.py`
    Standard logging utility used across Smash and in smashlets.
    Adds consistent emoji prefixes for log levels like info, warn, error, and debug.
    Part of the public smashlet API via `from smash import log`.
     Functions: log
     Lines of code: 20
- `smash_core/project.py`
    Manages project-level state, including project root detection and runlog persistence.
    - Locates the Smash project root (identified by a `.smash/` directory)
    - Reads and writes `.smash/runlog.json` with structured per-smashlet metadata
    Note: This module is internal and not part of the public Smash API.
     Functions: find_project_root, get_runlog, update_runlog
     Lines of code: 83
     (Imports: json, pathlib, smash_core.log, time)
- `smash_core/smashlets.py`
    This file runs all the `smashlet_*.py` files in the project.
    It handles finding them, deciding if they need to run (based on inputs, outputs, and timestamps),
    and executing their `run()` function with the right context.
    Used by the build system. Not part of the public API.
     Functions: discover_smashlets, load_smashlet_module, should_run, run_smashlet, touch
     Lines of code: 240
